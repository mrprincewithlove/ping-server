# Pinging Server

## Overview

The Pinging Server is a tool designed to monitor and track the response times of various network endpoints. It performs two main tasks:

1. **Ping Monitoring**: It continuously pings specified IP addresses or URLs to measure their round-trip time (RTT) in milliseconds. This helps in assessing the latency and availability of the network endpoints.

2. **Port Monitoring**: It checks the availability of a specific port (default is port 443) on the target IP addresses. This is useful for determining if services such as HTTPS are accessible.
